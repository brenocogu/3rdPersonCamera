# 3rdPersonCamera
Have you ever asked: Why this camera is so strange to me? Well, I'm researching and building this repo to save your develop life!

## Features
* **Character rotation not-linked with camera rotation**  
* **Always move to where the camera is point to, realtive to character rotation**
* **Some animations integrated with this system**  

## Know issues
* If you rotate the camera to max-value top or the max-value bottom (something like the head or the foot of the character, it'll flip in a strange movement  
* It ignores collision with some object's, leaving it inside that could cause some problems depending in the complexity of the object
